      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I am a software developer trying my hand at front-end web development. My initial hesistance to front-end development was due to my inability to grok positioning elements relative to each other with CSS. After watching <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7EIAgfkhmg">CSS FlexBox Essentials</a>, I decided to get hacking on a portfolio and chipping away at one challenge at a time. I enjoy programming and working specifically with front-end tools is refreshing. The goal of this portfolio is to create a layout with only HTML and CSS. In the near future, I plan to add links and descriptions to personal projects.</p>
